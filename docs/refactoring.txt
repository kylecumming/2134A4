1.
File: DohNat.java, District.java, Plant.java, Spresso.java, Mericano.java
Issue Idetified: SRP priciple was not being applied made a Plant class to seperate the plants from Districts]
Description of fix: Made 3 new classes, Plant.java, Spresso.java, and Mericano.java
Implemented: Yes all tests pass

2.File: ChickenBot.java, SpressoBot.java, TimBot.java, AngryBot.java, BullyBot.java
     Location (method/approx. line #): getNextMove()
     Issue Idetified: Common code to determine the the move with
     the lowest score
     Description of fix: push common code into TimBot.java, creating a protected
     method to used instead
     Implemented: yes using method lowestScore() in TimBot.java

File: ChickenBot.java, SpressoBot.java, TimBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): getNextMove()
   Issue Idetified: Common code to initialize variables used to determine
   the scores and current District that are used within the getNextMove() method.
   Description of fix: Create protected get methods that initalize each varibale
   within TimBot and call them from ChickenBot and SpressoBot to set values for their
   specific bot and for their getNextMove() methods.
   Not Implemented

4.
File: ChickenBot.java, SpressoBot.java, TimBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): getNextMove() - if (energyLevel > 0)
   Issue Idetified: in for loop to determine scores after checking the energy level,
   the code is the same in both ChickenBot and SpressoBot besides the values being
   applied to the new scores and adj.
   Description of fix: This for loop and if statement within can be pushed into the TimBot
   class and be placed inside of a protected method that takes in an input determining the
   amount each score is multiplied by when changed in scores[i] (i.e. for Chicken it is *1 for Spress *4)
   as well as the values added to scores[i] and adj within the if statement, i.e. 2000 or 2, 1000 or 1.
   This method can then be called by the respective classes within
   their getNextMove() methods.
